## Getting Started
ADDED INFORMATION
1. **Clone the repo and install dependencies:**

   cd Interview_ai_cohack
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev

> Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.  
> If needed, add your `.env` file (not included in the repo) for environment variables.

Guidelines:
- Work in branches and always ask for pull request after a rebase from the parent branch
- check the full working and minimize bugs before putting to production
- always maintain gitignore, no sensitive files to be uploaded like env or any auth realted files
